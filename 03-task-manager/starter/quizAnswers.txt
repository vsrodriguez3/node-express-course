You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.

    How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
        To access the information in the .env file, first, you ensure that the 'dotenv' package is installed
        in your application. Then, you create a ".env" file where you will store your environment variables with
        the sensitive information. Next, you include "require('dotenv').config();" in you main application file (app.js).
        This will allow you to access the environment variables in the .env file via process.env.VARIABLE_NAME.

    How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
        To protect the contents of the .env file from being stored in the Github repo, you include it in the .gitignore file.
